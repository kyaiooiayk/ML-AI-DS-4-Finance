## How is ML used in finance?
- Data mining to identify patterns, extract features and generate insights
- Supervised learning to generate risk factors or alphas and create trade ideas
- Aggregation of individual signals into a strategy
- Allocation of assets according to risk profiles learned by an algorithm
- The testing and evaluation of strategies, including through the use of synthetic data
- The interactive, automated refinement of a strategy using reinforcement learning

## Python libraries
- [FinQuant](https://github.com/fmilthaler/FinQuant)
- [TA-Lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/) TA-Lib is an open source library written in C++ with a Python interface that is widely used by trading software developers. It contains standardized implementations of over 200 popular indicators for technical analysis; that is, these indicators only use market data, namely price and volume information.
- [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) is an open source event-driven backtesting system library. It generates market events to simulate the reactions of an algorithmic trading strategy and tracks its performance. A particularly important feature is that it provides the algorithm with historical point-in-time data that avoids look-ahead bias. It is used to simulate realistic slippage, transaction costs and order delays. Process each event individually and avoids look-ahead bias. Zipline too is maintained by Quantopian.
- [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt) PyPortfolioOpt is a library that implements portfolio optimization methods, including classical mean-variance optimization techniques and Black-Litterman allocation, as well as more recent developments in the field like shrinkage and Hierarchical Risk Parity.
- [PyAlgoTrade](https://github.com/gbeced/pyalgotrade) is an event-driven algorithmic trading Python library which supports back-testing, live-feed paper trading and real-time trading on Bitstamp. No longer maintained.
- [Pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio) primarily deals with the risk analytics and performance related financial portfolios. This was developed and is maintained by Quantopian and was open-sourced in 2015. It works well with the Zipline open source backtesting library. Pyfolio library can be used to model tear sheets based on returns, Bayesian analysis and other transactions. 
- [quantecon](https://pypi.org/project/quantecon/) is a python library which consists of modules like game theory, Markov chains, random generation utilities (random), a collection of tools (tools), and other utilities (util) which are mainly used by developers internal to the package.
- [finmarketpy](https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy) is a Python-based library which enables you to analyze markets and backtest trading strategies using a simple to use API, which has inbuilt templates. With this library, one can visualise the trading strategies over a certain period and investigate the seasonality surrounding these strategies. It also allows the users to conduct surveys around specific events corresponding the data under consideration. An in-built calculator can be used to assess how volatile the targets are. It depends on pandas and NumPy libraries.
- [ffn](https://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pmorissette/ffn) has plenty to offer to those who belong to the field of quantitative finance. It provides a vast array of utilities, from performance measurement and evaluation to graphing and common data transformations.
