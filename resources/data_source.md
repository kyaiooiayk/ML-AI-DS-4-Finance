- [pandas_datareader](https://pydata.github.io/pandas-datareader/remote_data.html) extracts data from various Internet sources into a pandas DataFrame. It supports several remote data providers, including Alpha Vantage, World Bank, Eurostat, the OECD, and several stock markets such as the NASDAQ, Yahoo Finance, and Naver Finance. If you request a REST API, the response will come back in JSON format. However, DataReader will directly convert the API response into a DataFrame, which makes using APIs much simpler.
- SEC's EDGAR The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires US issuers, that is, listed companies and securities, including mutual funds to file three quarterly financial statements (Form 10-Q) and one annual report (Form 10-K), in addition to various other regulatory filing requirements. Since the early 1990s, the SEC made these filings available through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system. They constitute the primary data source for the fundamental analysis of equity and other securities, such as corporate credit, where the value depends on the business prospects and financial health of the issuer. SEC introduced XBRL, a free, open, and global standard for the electronic representation and exchange of business reports. XBRL is based on XML; it relies on taxonomies that define the meaning of the elements of a report and map to tags that highlight the corresponding information in the electronic version of the report.
