## How is ML used in finance?
- Data mining to identify patterns, extract features and generate insights
- Supervised learning to generate risk factors or alphas and create trade ideas
- Aggregation of individual signals into a strategy
- Allocation of assets according to risk profiles learned by an algorithm
- The testing and evaluation of strategies, including through the use of synthetic data
- The interactive, automated refinement of a strategy using reinforcement learning

## Python libraries
- [FinQuant](https://github.com/fmilthaler/FinQuant)
- [TA-Lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/) TA-Lib is an open source library written in C++ with a Python interface that is widely used by trading software developers. It contains standardized implementations of over 200 popular indicators for technical analysis; that is, these indicators only use market data, namely price and volume information.
- [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) is an open source event-driven backtesting system library. It generates market events to simulate the reactions of an algorithmic trading strategy and tracks its performance. A particularly important feature is that it provides the algorithm with historical point-in-time data that avoids look-ahead bias.
- [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt) PyPortfolioOpt is a library that implements portfolio optimization methods, including classical mean-variance optimization techniques and Black-Litterman allocation, as well as more recent developments in the field like shrinkage and Hierarchical Risk Parity.
