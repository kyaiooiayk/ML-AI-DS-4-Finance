# Modelling vs. strategy

- In finance, modelling and strategy are two distinct concepts, although they are often used in conjunction with each other.
- Modelling refers to the process of creating a mathematical or statistical representation of a financial or economic phenomenon. The goal of modelling is to analyze and understand how different variables interact and affect outcomes. Financial models can be used for a variety of purposes, such as forecasting future performance, valuing assets, and analyzing risk.
- On the other hand, strategy refers to a plan of action designed to achieve a specific goal or objective. In finance, a strategy typically involves making investment decisions based on a set of criteria or rules. For example, a value investing strategy involves buying stocks that are undervalued by the market based on metrics such as price-to-earnings ratios or book values.
- While modelling can be used to inform investment strategies, it is not the same as a strategy itself. A model can provide insights into the behavior of financial markets or the performance of particular investments, but it does not necessarily provide a prescription for how to invest. Strategy, on the other hand, is a deliberate plan of action that investors can use to guide their investment decisions.
- In summary, modelling is a tool used to analyze financial data, while strategy is a plan of action designed to achieve investment goals. While modelling can inform investment strategies, the two concepts are distinct from each other.
