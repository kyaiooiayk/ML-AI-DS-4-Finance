## Quant strategies
1. Data
2. Feature engineering
3. Expected returns
4. Trade or portfolio generation
- If you are RL then step 3 and 4 can be merged.
***

## Macro areas
- Research
- Back-testing
- Signal generation
- Portfolio construction & optimisation
- Risk management
- Trade execution
***

## Use case of ML4T
- Data mining to identify patterns, extract features and generate insights
- Supervised learning to generate risk factors or alphas and create trade ideas
- Aggregation of individual signals into a strategy
- Allocation of assets according to risk profiles learned by an algorithm
- The testing and evaluation of strategies, including through the use of synthetic data
- The interactive, automated refinement of a strategy using reinforcement learning
