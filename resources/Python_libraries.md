# Python libraries
***
- [FinQuant](https://github.com/fmilthaler/FinQuant)
- [TA-Lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/) TA-Lib is an open source library written in C++ with a Python interface that is widely used by trading software developers. It contains standardized implementations of over 200 popular indicators for technical analysis; that is, these indicators only use market data, namely price and volume information.
- [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) is an open source event-driven backtesting system library. It generates market events to simulate the reactions of an algorithmic trading strategy and tracks its performance. A particularly important feature is that it provides the algorithm with historical point-in-time data that avoids look-ahead bias. It is used to simulate realistic slippage, transaction costs and order delays. Process each event individually and avoids look-ahead bias. Zipline too is maintained by Quantopian.
- [PyPortfolioOpt](https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt) PyPortfolioOpt is a library that implements portfolio optimization methods, including classical mean-variance optimization techniques and Black-Litterman allocation, as well as more recent developments in the field like shrinkage and Hierarchical Risk Parity.
- [PyAlgoTrade](https://github.com/gbeced/pyalgotrade) is an event-driven algorithmic trading Python library which supports back-testing, live-feed paper trading and real-time trading on Bitstamp. No longer maintained.
- [Pyfolio](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio) primarily deals with the risk analytics and performance related financial portfolios. This was developed and is maintained by Quantopian and was open-sourced in 2015. It works well with the Zipline open source backtesting library. Pyfolio library can be used to model tear sheets based on returns, Bayesian analysis and other transactions.
- [quantecon](https://pypi.org/project/quantecon/) is a python library which consists of modules like game theory, Markov chains, random generation utilities (random), a collection of tools (tools), and other utilities (util) which are mainly used by developers internal to the package.
- [finmarketpy](https://github.com/cuemacro/finmarketpy) is a Python-based library which enables you to analyze markets and backtest trading strategies using a simple to use API, which has inbuilt templates. With this library, one can visualise the trading strategies over a certain period and investigate the seasonality surrounding these strategies. It also allows the users to conduct surveys around specific events corresponding the data under consideration. An in-built calculator can be used to assess how volatile the targets are. It depends on pandas and NumPy libraries.
- [ffn](https://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pmorissette/ffn) has plenty to offer to those who belong to the field of quantitative finance. It provides a vast array of utilities, from performance measurement and evaluation to graphing and common data transformations.
- [alphatools](https://github.com/marketneutral/alphatools) Quantitative finance research tools in Python
- [pandas-TA](https://twopirllc.github.io/pandas-ta/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) Pandas Technical Analysis (Pandas TA) is an easy to use library that leverages the Pandas package with more than 130 Indicators and Utility functions and more than 60 TA Lib Candlestick Patterns.

## Backtesting
- [VectorBT](https://vectorbt.dev/) is especially useful for performing thousands of iterations incredibly fast.
- [Backtesting.Py](https://kernc.github.io/backtesting.py/) is a very intuitive and mature library. Both projects are being actively maintained and have a thriving community of users providing constant feedback and creating content and tutorials.
