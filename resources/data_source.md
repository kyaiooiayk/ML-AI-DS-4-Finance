- [pandas_datareader](https://pydata.github.io/pandas-datareader/remote_data.html) extracts data from various Internet sources into a pandas DataFrame. It supports several remote data providers, including Alpha Vantage, World Bank, Eurostat, the OECD, and several stock markets such as the NASDAQ, Yahoo Finance, and Naver Finance. If you request a REST API, the response will come back in JSON format. However, DataReader will directly convert the API response into a DataFrame, which makes using APIs much simpler.
