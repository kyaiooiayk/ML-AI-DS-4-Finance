# - Any strategy could have a periods of mediocre returns and extensive drawdown. Thus a major challenge for quant researchers lies in identifying when a strategy is **truly underperforming** due to erosion of edge or whether it is a "temporary" period of poorer performance.
# - This motivates the need for an effective **trailing metric** that captures current performance of the strategy in relation to its previous performance.
# - One of the most widely used measures is the **annualised rolling Sharpe ratio**.

# - Now we can try the same calculation for a market-neutral strategy. The goal of this strategy is to fully isolate a particular equityâ€™s performance from the market in general.
#
# - The simplest way to achieve this is to go short an equal amount (in dollars) of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that is designed to track such a market. The most obvious choice for the US large-cap equities market is the S&P500 index, which is tracked by the SPDR ETF, with the ticker of SPY.
#
# - To calculate the annualised Sharpe ratio of such a strategy we will obtain the historical prices for SPY and calculate the percentage returns in a similar manner to the previous stocks, with the exception that we will not use the risk-free benchmark. We will calculate the net daily returns which requires subtracting the difference between the long and the short returns and then dividing by 2, as we now have twice as much trading capital.
